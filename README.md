Access:
This website is accessible by downloading the folder of files, using the terminal to change into this folder, typing the command "ng serve", and finally opening http://localhost:4200/ in a broswer window.

Current Design:
This website is designed to help compile centralized lists of RU students' favorite classes. Currently, you can only add classes in the By School that are core requirements for the School of Arts and Sciences/Rutgers Business School.

Targeted Design:
The goal is to allow users to add classes offered within other RU schools as well as add additional tabs to find course lists by major or by program. Other improvements include adding how many people recommend each course in the list and a filter option to filter by a specific school, major, or program within each separated tab.
